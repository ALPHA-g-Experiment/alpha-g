## Pull Requests

All contributions to `alpha-g` packages happen through pull requests. It is
highly recommended to discuss any change by opening an
[issue](https://github.com/ALPHA-g-Experiment/alpha-g/issues) before you start
working on a pull request. Additionally, please look at the GitHub actions
[workflows](https://github.com/ALPHA-g-Experiment/alpha-g/tree/main/.github/workflows)
to find out all the checks that your code has to pass before it can be
reviewed/merged.
