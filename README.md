# ALPHA-g

[![Test Status](https://github.com/DJDuque/alpha-g/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DJDuque/alpha-g/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

This is a [Cargo
Workspace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/workspaces.html) with
multiple library and binary crates useful in the data analysis of the ALPHA-g
experiment at CERN.

## Packages

- [Analysis](analysis/README.md): Set of executables that perform common 
post-processing/offline analysis on the MIDAS files generated by the experiment.
- [Detector](detector/README.md): Low-level library crate to handle the raw
output of the ALPHA-g detectors.
- [Physics](physics/README.md): Higher-level library crate to simplify physics
calculations based on the data collected from the ALPHA-g experiment.
