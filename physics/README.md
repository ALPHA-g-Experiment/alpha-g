A Rust library to reconstruct the annihilation events observed by the ALPHA-g
experiment detectors.

Reconstructing and analyzing the events in a data file is simple; a set of
examples with common operations can be found
[here](https://github.com/ALPHA-g-Experiment/alpha-g/tree/main/physics/examples).
